# BitZoom

A deterministic layout and hierarchical aggregation viewer for large property graphs. Nodes are positioned by property similarity using MinHash signatures and Gaussian projection, with stable zoom levels derived from stored uint16 grid coordinates via bit shifts.

## Key Ideas

- **Property-first layout** — nodes are positioned by what they are (properties), not who they're connected to (topology). Topology influence is a tunable parameter, not the primary organizing principle.
- **Near-linear preprocessing** — MinHash signatures + random projection, O(n) per node. No force-directed O(n²) computation.
- **Instant zoom** — all 14 aggregation levels derive from two stored uint16 coordinates per node via bit shifts. No recomputation on navigation.
- **Interactive strength tuning** — change property strengths and see the layout respond in real-time. No rehashing, no reprojection — just a strength-based blend of fixed 2D anchors.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Requires Deno (https://deno.land)
deno task serve
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

The viewer loads the default dataset and renders immediately. Use the dataset picker to switch between included datasets, or drop your own `.edges` and `.nodes` files.

## Data Format (SNAP)

### `.edges` (required)

Tab-delimited edge list. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```
# My graph
# Nodes: 100 Edges: 250
A	B
B	C	FRIEND
C	D	COLLEAGUE
```

2 columns (undirected) or 3 columns (with edge type).

### `.nodes` (optional)

Tab-delimited node properties. First comment line defines column names.

```
# NodeId	Label	Group	Score	Department
A	Alice	engineer	95	backend
B	Bob	designer	82	frontend
C	Carol	engineer		backend
D	Dave	manager	88
```

- Columns 1-3: NodeId, Label, Group (required structure)
- Additional columns become MinHash property groups
- Numeric columns auto-detected and tokenized at 3 resolution levels
- Empty fields = undefined (no false clustering)

## Converters

Convert external formats to SNAP:

```sh
# STIX 2.1 JSON bundle → SNAP
deno task stix2snap input.json data/output-prefix

# OpenCTI CSV export → SNAP (container similarity graph)
deno task csv2snap input.csv data/output-prefix

# Source code → SNAP call graph
deno task src2snap data/output-prefix
```

## Algorithm

1. **Tokenize** node properties into sets per property group
2. **MinHash** (k=128) each token set into a fixed-length signature via universal hashing
3. **Project** each z-score normalized signature to 2D via a seeded Gaussian random matrix (one per group)
4. **Blend** the per-group 2D positions as a weighted combination + optional topology smoothing
5. **Quantize** blended positions to a uint16 grid (65536×65536) — Gaussian (default, density-preserving) or rank (uniform occupancy)
6. **Zoom** by bit-shifting grid coordinates: level L gives a 2^L × 2^L cell grid

Strength changes only repeat steps 4-5: O(n × G) for anchor recomputation plus O(passes × (n + |E|)) for topology smoothing when α > 0. Zoom is O(1) per node. Signatures are not stored — recomputed on demand for detail panel visualization. See [SPEC.md](agent_docs/SPEC.md) for the full algorithm design.
